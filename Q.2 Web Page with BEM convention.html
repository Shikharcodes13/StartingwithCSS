    <div class="money">
        <p class="p1">Money is the basic requirement of the life without which one cannot imagine a healthy and peaceful life. We need money even buying a little needle. In the modern time, where growth of civilization is going very fast and following western culture, we need more money because of the increasing prices of everything.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p2"> Earlier there was a system called barter system in which one was allowed to exchange things to get goods however, in the modern one need only money to buy everything.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p3">he importance of money is increasing day by day as the living has become so costly. The significance of money has increased to a great extent in the field of production, consumption, exchange, distribution, public finance and etc. It plays a very crucial role in determining the input, income, employment, output, general price level of anything, etc.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="p4">In such a costly and competitive society and world, no one of us can live without money. We need money to fulfil our basic needs of the life such as buying food, and other many basic necessities of life which are almost impossible to buy without money. </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p5">People in the society who are rich and have property are looked as honourable and respectful person of the society however a poor person is seen as hatred without any good impression.</p>
